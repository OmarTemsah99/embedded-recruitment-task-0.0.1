<!-- Server.rs -->

1. Client Struct:

Both versions: Define a Client struct to manage communication with a connected client.

2. Client::handle Method:

Old Version:

Potentially used a larger buffer size than necessary.
Decoded messages without explicit error handling.
Included logic for handling AddRequest and EchoMessage (not shown in the provided snippet).
New Version:

Uses a buffer size of 512 bytes, which might be sufficient for most echo messages.
Explicitly checks the return value of EchoMessage::decode to handle potential decoding errors.
Focuses on handling EchoMessage for simplicity (assuming AddRequest handling is removed or implemented elsewhere).
Provides more informative error messages for debugging purposes.

3. Server Struct:

Old Version:

Used Mutex to manage the listener, potentially introducing some overhead.
New Version:

Uses a plain TcpListener for the listener, simplifying the code.

4. Server::new Method:

Both versions:

Create a new server instance, binding it to a specific address.
New Version:

Might be slightly more concise due to the simpler Server struct.

5. Server::run Method:

Old Version:

Potentially did not set the listener to non-blocking mode.
New Version:

Explicitly sets the listener to non-blocking mode for better performance and handling incoming connections efficiently.

6. Error Handling:

Old Version:

Error handling might have been less detailed.
New Version:

Includes more specific error messages for accept and handle methods, aiding in debugging.

7. Additional Considerations:

The new code removes any logic related to AddRequest handling (assuming it's implemented elsewhere or not needed).
The new code focuses on a simpler echo server functionality.
Overall, the new server.rs code offers several improvements:

Clarity and Conciseness: The code is more streamlined and easier to understand.
Error Handling: Provides more informative error messages for debugging.
Efficiency: Uses non-blocking mode for the listener, potentially improving performance.
Focus: Tailored to handle EchoMessage for demonstration purposes.

<!-- client_test.rs -->

1. Server Startup Wait:

Old Version: Tests assumed the server starts immediately.
New Version: Introduces a std::thread::sleep call (200 milliseconds) after server creation to ensure the server is ready before client connection attempts.

2. Response Timeout:

Both Versions: Validate successful message reception.
New Version: Introduces timeout logic using Instant::now and Duration to measure the time taken for receiving a response. It asserts that the response arrives within 1 second (adjustable). This enhances test reliability by preventing them from hanging indefinitely if the server is slow or unresponsive.

3. Multiple Echo Messages:

Old Version: The test (test_multiple_echo_messages) was ignored.
New Version: The test is fixed and now sends and receives multiple echo messages from a single client, verifying their content matches what was sent.

4. Multiple Clients:

Old Version: The test (test_multiple_clients) was ignored.
New Version: The test is fixed and now creates and connects multiple clients concurrently. Each client sends and receives multiple echo messages, ensuring the server handles concurrent connections and messages appropriately.

5. Add Request Test:

Old Version: The test (test_client_add_request) was ignored (likely due to missing server-side implementation for AddRequest).
New Version: The test remains ignored, but the code is preserved for potential future use if the server starts supporting AddRequest functionality.
Overall, the new client test code offers several improvements:

Increased Robustness: Ensures server startup and introduces timeouts for receiving responses.
Enhanced Clarity: Includes timeout logic with clear comments.
Comprehensive Testing: Fixes previously ignored tests to cover multiple echo messages, concurrent clients, and (potentially in the future) AddRequest handling.
